## Getting Started
This website and repository uses the Tailwind CSS style library. Tailwind CSS compiles only the necessary styles used within the repository's code. To have Tailwind CSS build the `tailwind.css` file, you can either build the styles after each update or have Tailwind watch the files and update automatically once it detects changes.

```bash
npm run build
```
```bash
npm run watch 
```
